# unam-session-dialog
Power options and session management for Unam desktop

**Info:**
This program is heavily inspired in the cb-exit script ([found here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150420023234/http://ndever.net/articles/linux/install-openbox-ubuntu-1304-1310)). It has been adapted to support the change to systemd

# How to use
1. Make folder /usr/share/unam os/Apps/unam-session-dialog
2. Copy all files to the new folder, except the sh file (filename with no extension)
3. Copy the shell script to /usr/bin and add execution privileges
